# Medkit
Medkit is a web application designed in a way that it is capable of providing all the facilities required for the smooth working of a hospital.
It can easily manage the data of the patients and allow smooth flow within the hospital.
Prescriptions prescribed by the doctor will be updated which can easily be accessed by the pharmacy and lab staff for medicine and medical test.
Further reports get updated in the database so that they can be examined by the doctor.
This application will be a complete guide to a patient about the hospital and at the same time a good managing tool for management.
